# void-strider

A game written in Game Maker Language using Game Maker Studio 2

### The Idea

I wanted to create a retro style game where a pointer-style spaceship shoots at asteroids to survive.
And as a byproduct I have learned some new useful math functions and use-cases for gaming and programming in general.
